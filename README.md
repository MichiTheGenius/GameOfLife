# Conway's Game of Life
A C++ implementation of John Horton Conway's cellular automaton. It uses the SFML framework to display the necessary graphics.

## Usage

- clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/MichiTheGenius/GameOfLife
    ```

- install the `SFML` C++ library (it is a needed dependency)
    - for Debian/Ubuntu based Linux-systtems the command would be:
        ```sh
        sudo apt install libsfml-dev
        ```


- compile and run the program; a Makefile is provided to simplify the process (works only for unix/linux operating systems)
    ```sh
    make
    ```
